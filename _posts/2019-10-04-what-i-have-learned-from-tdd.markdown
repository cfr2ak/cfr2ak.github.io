## What I have learned from TDD?

### How I fell in love with TDD?

I just happen to read the book <em>Test Driven Development with Python </em>by Harry Percival. I always suffer from consistency of my encouragement to finish my side project (as anybody else, ideas were always awesome). But after finish this book, I learned how to anything with incremental way. The key was the confidence from hard basis, not emotional boost or something like 'just do it'.

### What I learned from it?

I've learned from it a lot from many perspective. Not only for programming area but also physics, mathematics, philosophy, and so on. I started to value questions more than answers when I read philosophical resources. And I started to value experiments more than equations when I study physics at my university. And I started to value prove more than theorem itself when I study mathematics. And, for sure, I started to value test more than code when I program.

You may be noticed that blog posts I've written has questions above every paragraph. This is how I started write any material regardless of it is reports or paper or blog post; to think and define questions first ahead of content itself. Quite TDD-like, isn't it?

### Which one I think that is important?

Four statements below is what I'm following to do anything in my life for now.

<ol><li><strong>Questions</strong> over conclusions</li><li><strong>Experiments</strong> over equations</li><li><strong>Proves</strong> over theorems</li><li><strong>Tests</strong> over codes</li></ol>

Before I learn TDD, that statements were just completely inverse for my value decision. I valued conclusions, equations, theorems, and codes over questions, experiments, proves, and tests because I thought they are more important because they are something like always required at my school test.

### Why questions over conclusions?

No conclusion come from void. There is always a question that requires certain conclusion. And conclusion happen to like something depends on the periodic background it made. If you know the question, then you can create new conclusion which answers better for that question rather than old conclusion which has narrower perspective than you may have. But if you only knows conclusion, there is no way to create your originals in anyway because you've only learned some conclusions are absolute true and the story ends there.

<h2>Why experiments over equations?</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This one is almost same as a paragraph above. Experiments matters because if you don't know how experiments are executed, then you don't know where the equations are from. These equations are just like magic word if you don't care about experiments created them. Some genius physicist said that, and you obey it with no doubt.</p>

### Why proves over theorems?

Again, this one sames too. Where those theorems are from? Just like a long time ago there was a genius mathematician? No, they prove it. They did it from basic knowledge which everyone has in incremental way. If you don't like to think theorems like quotes on bible, then you should know proves of it.

### Why tests over codes?

This one is from TDD forks and there is nothing much I can say with. But my perspective is like this, you interacts with code with wanted behavior and it is which is called manual test. 

And again, if you don't write tests, or don't know how is it tested, the whole code is just like magic which you cannot touch in a trivial way. We know this sort of things a lot: the legacy code.

### What I want to say consequently?

I can suggest you to value question, experiment, prove, test more than their results. But I think it is better to make this statement more general.
