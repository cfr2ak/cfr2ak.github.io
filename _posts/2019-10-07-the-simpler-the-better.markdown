## The simpler the better?

### Why people says that the simpler the better?

In my field, the physics, many people believes that the simpler the better. Like the famous quote from Albert Einstein:

> "If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself" - Albert Einstein

Or from Richard Feynman:

> "If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it" - Richard Feynman

And yes, I don't believe the person who says something like mysterious, unknown magic while they claim themselves as a expert. If they are experts, then they should have control over they field. At least, they should not think their knowledge as a magical thing.

### But really? The simpler the better?

I agree on the statement 'The simpler the better', but it contains a misuse of words which makes people to conceive this like 'The simplest is the best'. No, it's not. The statement is not about extreme. Nobody can explain quantum physics. Does this means that the quantum physics is no more than a giant failure of the science history? You know we cannot say that trivially because you can read this post thanks to communication engineering which heavily uses quantum physics.

### What is it about then?

It is about the direction we should take. Many physicists are really great at math (I'm not the case, but anyway it's true on average) which is the language we use when we need to get the state or change of the state the target. There always a temptation to create a equation which perfectly fits the phenomenon, but this leads to overfit which is frequently comes up in AI context (I recommend you to search on overfitting, there are plenty of resources explain it). Einstein and Feynman knows this temptation which makes them say something like 'the simpler the better'. This statement does not mean that the equation should can be explained solely on prealgebra. It only reminds and suggest the direction to the experts who is really good at math which leads to the temptation to create a equation which is too complex to generalize the phenomenon.

### So, follow it or not?

You need to know that the statement 'The simpler the better' does not means that 'The simplest, the best' which leads to the conclusion that all the knowledge we cannot explain to our cat (They may know the truth but anyway we cannot check their knowledge functionally because we do not know their clever language). You should remind 'The simpler the better' when you're in temptation to create something to specific which cannot be generalized in any way.
