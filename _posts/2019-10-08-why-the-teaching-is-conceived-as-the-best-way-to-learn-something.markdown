## Why the teaching is conceived as the best way to learn something?

### What it means when we say 'teach someone'?

Teaching someone else means that we transfer our instincts by our language. We sometimes use white board, power points, and videos for teaching but we do not say someone teaching us if he only gives you a bunch of books instead of saying something to you in brief.

When we say someone teaches us or we teach someone, it means that we communicates somebody who has more or less knowledge compared to us.

### Which method I think the best for learning?

As I said on my blog's post before, I value questions way more than conclusions, because conclusions itself does not mean anything.

For example, it has no meaning you know <em>F = ma</em> if you do not care about how things are accelerated by force, or you do not make inquiries about the true nature of moves of the things you encounter including stars. And even more, <em>F = ma</em> is not the absolute truth as proved by many quantum experiments. If you do not knows the question below some knowledge, not even you cannot create your new, original conclusions, you cannot use that knowledge fully in practical terms.

Therefore, I think the question is the key to learn anything. We cannot create knowledge first. We always throw questions first and we make conclusions on it based on our experiences.

### Why the teaching is so effective?

When you're teaching somebody else than you, you cannot avoid questions from them. If you're learning something from somebody else, then you should throw questions to make all things clear in your mind.

This is the reason why the teaching is conceived as the best way to learn something. You and I cannot avoid uncomfortable questions which disrupts our minds which is easy to avoid when we are study alone. We've heard it a lot from the influencers; 'Get out of your comfort zone'. Yes, what you need is question to follow that mantra on your own.

Teaching is just a catalyst prohibit yourself to get into your comfort zone so easily.  The key is the question, not teaching.
