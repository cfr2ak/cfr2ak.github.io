## Why you should try the Pomodoro technique?

### What is Pomodoro?

Pomodoro is a technique to manage your time. Here's the process of it.

<ol><li>Decide what to do for next 25 minutes</li><li>One Pomodori<ol><li>Set up your timer to 25 minutes and start</li></ol><ol><li>Focus hard for the task</li><li>DO NOT go to the toilet</li><li>DO NOT fill up your mug</li></ol></li><li>Short break<ol><li>Set up your timer to 5 minutes for rest and start the timer</li></ol><ol><li>Now, go to toilet, fill up your mug with coffee, and so on</li></ol></li><li>Repeat 1 to 3 three times more (4 times in total)</li><li>Long break<ol><li>Set up your timer to 15 minutes for rest and start the timer</li></ol></li><li>Back to number 1 and repeat</li></ol>

That's all. What you really need is only a timer (I prefer to use a tool above this like Trello + Pomello) and the time you can focus without disturbance while you're executing a cycle.

### Why people using it?

People say the reason for using Pomodoro is to measure their productivity. For example, if you finished 16 Pomodori a day, then you did a 8 hours job done with focus (it's not exactly 8 hours but approximately). You don't need to worry you work a minute or two more or less than you thought because you can be confidence that you focused while you're in each cycle. 

### Why is it useful?

The first condition of your focus is not pushing hard yourself, but the absence of disturbance. Of course, you can focus without Pomodoro technique thinking like 'I'll focus on next 2 hours for this one'. But Pomodoro helps you to focus more easily than you used to. It's about methodology.

Let's make an analogy to make this more clear. If you're someone from the CS background, then you should be familiar with multi-threading. And you should know that multi-threading is the source of many untrackable errors (which makes you find where's the aspirin in). For example, if you run two thread increments the variable in the same address, like 1000 each, your expectation of the result is 2000 but the actual one is around 1300 or so. It's not because of the computation is jumped in each thread. It is caused from the memory shared with two computation running at the same time.

Programmers usually solve this problem by lock their memory with something like mutex lock which protects the memory shared with multiple threads.

Now let's think about us, the human. We can do several jobs at the same time, but our memory, our brain, is only one. It results in the same outcome with computer; you put 2000 efforts of your computing resource but you got 1300 only because you got only one for your brain, not two.

Pomodoro acts like mutex lock for us. Pomodoro locks 25 minutes as a chunk and protects your brain from shared along the tasks you should do. Unlike you're doing your work simultaenously and get the result less than your effort, Pomodoro makes you produce exactly proportional to your effort.

Give it a try. It does not hurt you anyway.
