## Are you interested in AI? I mean, really?

I work in the company which sells the AI solution and I saw many people says 'I want to try AI on my own', and after a half a year of their experience, the same people says 'I think I'm not interested in AI actually' and they go to find another cool things such as block chain, singularity, robotics and says 'I think this is not my way' again and again. I know you know what I'm saying about if you're engaged in this absolutely bubbled AI industry. And here is my perspective.

## What I've seen as an applied physics student

I'm an applied physics undergraduate student. And I saw many of my classmates interested in quantum physics at the very first time of their major. They do the exactly same thing: 'this is not what I've thought'. Yes, quantum physics is not even close to the multi-universe in an SF novel. It is full of math with which excludes any comprehensive interpretation intent. Because the physicist like Dirac had found (experienced) that any human language failed to explain the quantum phenomena with good accuracy, they simply gave up doing that. They believe that the result of the experiment is the sole base of the scientific truth, not their language. They rather choose to engineer the microscopic nature with the math. As Feynman said 'Shut up and just calculate!'.

## Shut up and just code

There was Newton dynamics in physics. And there is an Dijkstra's formalism on the structured programming. Common part between them? They have failed on more complex problem. Newton dynamics is mathematically beautiful and can be explained with human language flawlessly. Just as same, the Dijkstra's structured programming model is mathematically beautiful and can be explained with human language which is called algorithm.

Many people says something like 'The AI no more than that of the bleeding edge tech of automation'. I don't agree, because the things the vocabulary 'AI' directs to is not a mere automation. This is a fundamental paradigm transformation in the computer science industry.

Until now, most of the programs are can be described by the human's natural language and that is what we called algorithm. And some of the programs has a concrete base of math beneath of it which assures the true value (not the same meaning when we call true in the boolean algebra. Right value maybe closer to this context) can be retrieved if the mathematical theorems are right (And they are almost always right).

AI cannot be described by algorithm. Only training them can have algorithms but the actions they take base on the input which is retrieved from the environment are a pure stochastic process. Programmer may able to check how a feature (of the environment it observes) is analyzed on each layer inside of it, but the true anatomy of the AI does not exist. We can see how they act on certain input space, but we cannot assure it works same on a completely new environment since we have no model to predict that.

I feels like this flow is identical to what physicist experienced on the early 20 century. We can see the result, but how they work? Can we explain and control them or have to admit them as it is and do something just like 'Shut up and just code!'?

## Admit that you don't have full control on it

I think this is the time to admit that the AI is not on our hand, or at least cannot be described by our language which is a mere procedure ties of meanings. May be it is better to code than to try explain them, as physicist did a hundred years ago.
